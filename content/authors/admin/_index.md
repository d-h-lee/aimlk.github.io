<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
I am an assistant professor in Department of Mathematics, Korea University. 
I have been leading AIML@K since 2021, with the goal of educating future leaders and colleagues aware of the importance of bridging artificial intelligence and mathematics.

<!-- 연구분야/주제 관심사 소개 -->
My personal research themes include learning to make wise decisions under uncertainty, efficiency of machine learning algorithms, explainable and verifiable artificial intelligence. 
I believe that research with solid ties to real applications and practical impact is as important as research in abstract setting that maximizes generalizability.

<!-- 그 외의 것/trivia -->
My Ph.D. started in 2009 and ended in 2019: in the midst of my Ph.D. decade I also worked as a (senior) software engineer at Samsung Electronics. Meanwhile, I have been putting efforts into public outreaches regarding significant events and impactful findings in my field of research and interest, such as "Dissecting AlphaGo" (알파고 해부하기) series. 
Additional details can be found in my [curriculum vitae](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QZI5EFBZ3Xsw4TMAHOI6sB7T_JsBC7y4UUIAGhU-sXo/edit?usp=sharing).
